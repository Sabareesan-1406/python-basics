# iterating over elements in a list - this is a very commonly used use-case in programming
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    print(x)

# recap, a string is sequence of charters too, you can iterate on a string just like we do on a list
my_string = "banana"
for x in my_string:
    print(x)
