# a set is immutable sequence and it is not indexed and cannot changed.

# my_set.append is not allowed since set is immutable,  so you cannot add an element from tuple

# my_set.pop is not allowed since set is immutable, so you cannot remove an element from tuple
# my_set.sort is not allowed since set cannot be ordered


my_set = {"a", "b", "c"}
print(f"my_set = {my_set}")

# notice everytime you run this program, the order of the set printed will be changing
