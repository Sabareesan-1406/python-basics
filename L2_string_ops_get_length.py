# there is no declaration of variables in python, because it is a loosely types programming language, instead we
# initialize the string as follows, this means we are assigning a default value to the variable.

my_string = "my cool string"

# getting the length of the string and store it into a variable
string_length = len(my_string)

# print the length of the string
print("my_string length : ", string_length)
